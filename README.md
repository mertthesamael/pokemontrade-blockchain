Hey there, this is Merto. I decided to make a DaPP with my favorite series theme. Of course, this DaPP works on Polygon-Mumbai testnet for obvious reasons lol.
*(I don't wanna get sued by Ash Ketchum)*

So basically, with this contract you can mint 1 NFT per account, and you can set a trade for it !

And if you liked the offered one, you can confirm the trade and finalize the tsx. By this way, tokens that 2 account has is changes with each others.(And also the theme of the DaPP changes based on the token that you held.) There is 4 Pokémon option to mint. It's refferance to Ash Ketchum's first choice at Oak's lab :wink:

So i'll go with technicals :

# Token URI
I've used Pinata for IPFS gateway. And here is a look the metadata structura that i build:

# Smart Contract Developming
In the process of developing the smart contract, i've used both Remix IDE and Hardhat. In the final version, contract is deployed via Hardhat.

# Front End Connections

So this was the real pain. First I started with ethers. I had lots of errors and unexpected bugs. Then i figured out how to use ethers. Then i realised i just f*cked up. It was emotionally roller coaster fr. After i learned a bit ethers, i figured out there is some library called RainbowKit and Wagmi. Yes. It was time to learn new 2 libraries and forget the old one that i just learned(?).
